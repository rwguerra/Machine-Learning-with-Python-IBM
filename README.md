# Machine-Learning-with-Python-IBM

This course dives into the basics of machine learning using an approachable, and well-known programming language, Python. 

In this course, i did reviewed two main components:
First, i learned about the purpose of Machine Learning and where it applies to the real world. 
Second, i got a general overview of Machine Learning topics such as supervised vs unsupervised learning,  model evaluation, and Machine Learning algorithms. 

In this course, it was possible to practice with real-life examples of Machine learning and see how it affects society in ways i may not have guessed!

By just putting in a few hours a week, this is what i got.
1) Review some skills such as regression, classification, clustering, sci-kit learn and SciPy 
2) New projects, including cancer detection, predicting economic trends, predicting customer churn, recommendation engines, and many more.
3) And a certificate in machine learning.
